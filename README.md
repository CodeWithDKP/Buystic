> ⚠️ **Note:**  
> 1. Currently, there are **no products on the Products page** by default. You need to login to the **Admin Dashboard** to manage products (add, approve, edit, delete) and see everything.  
> 2. There is **no backend yet**. In the future, a backend will be added to handle data dynamically.
